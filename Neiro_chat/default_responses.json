        "text": "Trouble Shooting in Batch Determination\n2024\nThis instruction defines the procedure for an employee to follow providing advice on trouble shooting in batch determination.\nTASKS\nThe main objectives of the instruction are:\ndescription of the steps to take to trouble shooting in batch determination.\nPERIOD OF VALIDITY AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CHANGES\nChanges to the instruction are made when new settings appear in the SOFTWARE, as well as when information on current settings is updated.\nTROUBLE SHOOTING IN BATCH DETERMINATION\nPurpose\nGet to know how to analyze the problem that occurs during batch determination.\nOverview\nBatch determination is usually used in:\nInventory Management, like stock transfer order to determine the issuing batch of the issuing plant.\nProduction process, like production order/process order to determine the issuing batch of the raw material during production.\nSales process, like sales order and outbound delivery to determine the issuing batch of the goods that is ordered.\nWarehouse management.\nAnalysis:\nMain Screen of batch determination:\nMain mode of Batch determination:\nAutomatically in background.\nManually in foreground.\nMail problem during batch determination:\nThe batch is not determined at all.\nThe determined batch is not desired.\nThe determined batch is correct but the split quantity is not correct.\nNormal Analysis process of batch determination:\nWhen there is a problem of the batch determination result, you first need to check if you can use manually batch determination in foreground, if you can, then trigger the batch determination manually with on-line process again to reach the main screen of batch determination. You need to aware that even if the batch determination carried out in badkground automatically, you still have the chance to repeat it on-line manually again. For example, in VL02N the processing of outbound delivery, the batch determination may happened already, but you still can go to the batch split view by clicking the \"Batch Split\" button and press the \"Change Batch Determination\" button to enter the main screen of the batch determination.\nOn the main screen of the batch determination, the batches that are listed in Batch selection section are the proposed sorted and selected batches, if the result here has a problem, then you need first checking the Log. On the main screen, click the \"Log\" button, there will be a popup:\nThere is an \"Expand\" button, press it TWICE untill the list is expanded totally. On the expanded detail list, you will see the records of the whole batch determination process, there will be RED highlighted items, the cause of why certain batch is deleted at certain stage during the batch determination is clearly listed. From the records, you can see that, normally the batch stock selection will have no many problems as this step is to pick up all the related batches that has stocks unless there is stock determination involved. The problems normally occur at selection criteria stage and availability check stage, the batch you want to keep may be deleted but the batch you do not want to keep is kept wrongly.\nIf the problem occurs at selection criteria stage, then you need check the\"Selection criteria\", there will be another popup after you pressing this button, the charasteristics and characteristic values for the corresponding selection class of the batch search strategy will be shown in this popup. You can open another session and check the classification of the deleted batches in MSC3N to see if they do match the selection criteria you have defined.\nBut if the selection criteria on the \"Selection criteria\" popup is not the one you think it should be, then you need to analyze your batch search strategy. Press the \"Strategy Analysis\" button, you will enter another screen:\nThere wll be many strategy type and search strategy listed, you need to explode them to find one with GREEN traffic light, this is the search strategy used for this batch determination, it's easily to find out why this strategy will be used. In the Access details area, you can see what condition is considered when picking up this strategy, compare it with your real data, you may see normally the strategy is the only one qualified with the conditions. So if the search strategy or the selection class has a problem, then you may find the search condition from here and check if this is the reason of why certain batch is not selected, then you can adjust the characteristic value or the characteristic in the selection class, or adjust the batch classification data to make the batch picked by the batch determination process.\nIf the problem happens in \"Availability\", then you need to press the \"Availability\" button to goto the availability check screen. This is exactly the same with CO09, you can see why the picked out batch looks has stocks but deleted because of no enough stock. This is normally because that the whole batch stock or part of the batch stock is occupied by other orders or requirements, if you still hope this batch can be used, then you need to add more stockto this batch or release the stocks that are occupied by the other orders or requirements.\nIf the batch number and batch quantity are determined correctly by batch determination but only the sorting or the spliting of the selected batches has problem, then you need to check the details of the current batch search strategy, you can press the \"Strategy info\" button to check, in the new popup:\nyou can see how the batch spliting is defined and what is the sorting rule. You can manually sort the picked out batches base on the sort rule defined here, then you will see if the result is correct, normally, then problem is caused by the improper sort rule defination. You just need to adjust your sort rule to make it work.\nRelated Transaction Code\nOCHA - Customizing\nMBC1/MBC2/MBC3 - Search strategy for inventory management\nCOB1/COB2/COB3 - Search strategy for production/process order\nVCH1/VCH2/VCH3 - Search strategy for sales and distributions\nLS51/LS52/LS53 - Search strategy for warehouse management\nBMC1/BMC2/BMC3 - Maintain selection class\nCU70/CU71/CU72 - Maintain sorting rule\n",

If the fan fails, then the temperatures inside the CPU case will significantly increase, which creates the potential for overheating. The easiest way to clean a CPU fan is to use a can of compressed air.\nTHINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW\nAlways power off your PC and remove any connected power cords before cleaning its CPU fan.\nAfter opening your computer according to the owner's manual, position your can of compressed air two inches from the surface you intend to clean.\nSpray compressed air in short puffs over the CPU fan's blades.\nSteps:\nShut down your PC and turn the power off.\nRemove the power cords from the rear of the tower and disconnect them from their power source.\nPlace the tower on top of an anti-static mat that has been laid on top of a table.\nYou may also wear an antistatic wristband that is connected to an electrical ground, like a metal plumbing fixture. You'll need to use the antistatic devices because static discharge from the floor or from your body could damage data stored on the computer.\nOpen the back of the computer case according to the directions in your owner's manual.\nSome CPU's will require screwdrivers for removal, while others will have buttons to depress before the back comes off.\nPosition your can of compressed air at least two inches from the surface that you are cleaning.\nClean the fan intakes and the exhaust using short puffs of canned air.\nThe intakes are the grid-like structures that filter the air that comes into the fan.\nSpray short puffs of canned air over the fan blades.\nTo loosen clumps of dirt, hold your canned air at multiple angles rather than using long bursts of air. Make sure that you do not touch anything inside of the CPU tower.\nSet the canned air aside and close the back of your CPU.\nClean the exterior of your CPU with a damp cloth that has been dipped in soapy, lukewarm water.\nDry the surface with a soft towel.\nUse a damp cloth to clean your power cords while they are disconnected from a power source.\nDry the power cords with a soft towel.\nReturn the power cords to their correct positions and power up your computer.\n",

Whoever creates the purchase requisition determines which material or service in which quantity, and for which date have to be ordered.\nIndirectly\nIndirectly means that the purchase requisition from another component is created automatically. Purchase requisitions can be created automatically in the following ways:\nMaterial requirement planning (MRP)\nMaintenance orders\nPlanned orders\nNetworks\nYou can also initiate purchase requisitions from SAP Ariba.\nWhen you create a purchase requisition for materials that have a material master record, the system transfers the data in the material master record to the purchase requisition. You also have the option to select items from a web-based catalog.\nYou can convert purchase requisitions into requests for quotations (RFQs), purchase orders (POs), or outline agreements.\nPurchase Requisition Processing\nACCOUNT ASSIGNMENT OBJECTS\nIf you buy material, you procure it either for stock or for direct consumption.\nYou need to enter an account assignment for an item under the following circumstances:\nIf you order a material that is not subject to value-based inventory management and post its value directly to consumption (pure consumable material)\nIf you order an article that does not have a material master record\nIf you order a service\nIf you want to procure a material as a consumable, you must specify an account assignment category and other account assignment data in the document item of the purchase requisition or purchasing document.\nThe account assignment category determines the account assignment object category that is to be charged. You must provide the account assignment data. The accounts are debited when the goods receipt or invoice is posted.\nThe following are the examples of account assignment objects:\nThe account assignment object cost center (account assignment category K): When you make an account assignment to a cost center, you must enter the general ledger (G/L) account number of the consumption account. You must also enter the cost center for which the material will be procured on the account assignment data screen. You can specify that the system automatically proposes the number of the GL account to be charged in Customizing.\nThe account assignment object asset (account assignment category A): If you use account assignment category A, you have to enter the asset number on the account assignment data screen. The system automatically determines the G/L account to charge based on the asset number you cannot enter manually.\nPROCUREMENT FOR CONSUMPTION\nWhen you procure a material directly for consumption, no material master record is necessary.\nThe characteristics of consumable materials with a master record are as follows:\nThere is no value-based inventory management.\nThe system automatically updates consumption in the material master record.\nIn SAP S/4HANA, the term \"consumable material\" is any material subject to procurement whose value is settled using cost element accounts or asset accounts. Therefore, a consumable material is procured directly for an account assignment object.\nWhen procuring a consumable material without a material master record, you have to enter a short description, a material group, and a purchase order unit in the document manually. You have to do this because you cannot fetch this data from a master record. This is not true for a material with a master record. For these materials, the material type controls whether inventory management takes place on a value basis.\nWhen you procure a consumable material, a material master record is not required, but can be used.\nYou can procure stock material for consumption. In all cases, you must specify an account assignment category and other dependent account assignment data, such as an account assignment object and a G/L account (consumption account). At the time of goods receipt or invoice receipt, the system debits the consumption account the purchase order specifies with the procurement value. Additionally, the system posts the amount to the account assignment object.\nCreating a Purchase Requisition\nA purchase requisition can be created from a MRP run.  If a purchase requisition line item is a consumable for a cost object, then upon saving the purchase requisition, a commitment in Management Accounting is created. Please note: Commitment Management within Management Accounting needs to be activated.\nCreating a Purchase Order\nIf a purchase order line item is a consumable for a cost object, then upon saving the purchase order, a commitment in Management Accounting is created. Please note: Commitment Management within Management Accounting needs to be activated.\nPosting a Goods Receipt\nWhen you save a goods receipt for stock materials, on hand inventory is increased.\nIf a change in material valuation occurred, then the system creates an accounting document in Financial Accounting.\nIf the purchase order was for consumable materials, the system not only creates an accounting document in Financial Accounting, but also creates a controlling document in Management Accounting and creates a document to update the Material Ledger.\nIf the organization is using Warehouse Management, then the system creates a transfer requirement.\nLastly, the system updates the purchase order history.\nPosting an Invoice Receipt\nWhen an invoice is posted, the system creates an accounting document, in Financial Accounting to record the liability owed to the vendor.  The system, also creates an open item against the vendor’s account.\nIf the purchase order was for consumable materials, and the invoice amount differs from the purchase order amount, then the system creates a controlling document, in Management Accounting.\nOutgoing Payment\nWhen the outgoing payment is posted to the vendor, a Financial Accounting document is created. The open item against the vendor's account is cleared and our bank account pays the balance due. This can be performed manually or automatically.\n",

Unplug and restart your printer\nSometimes power cycling your printer can resolve the issue. Turn off your printer and unplug it, wait 30 seconds, plug your printer back in, and then turn the printer back on.\nIf your printer still doesn’t work, continue to step 2.\nStep 2. Check cables or wireless connection\nCheck the cables (for wired printers). Make sure that the printer's USB cable is properly connected from the printer to your PC. If your USB isn’t recognized, see Automatically diagnose and fix Windows USB problems.\nCheck the wireless connection (for wireless printers). Do one of the following:\nMake sure the printer’s wireless option is turned on and available. Many printers have a button that displays a blue wireless icon when a wireless connection option for the printer is available. To learn where this button is located on your printer and to find instructions about how to turn it on, see the instructions that came with the printer or check the manufacturer's website for instructions.\nRun the printer’s wireless connectivity test. Many printers have a menu option to test the printer’s wireless connectivity. Read the instructions that came with the printer or check the printer manufacturer’s website for instructions about how to do this.\nIf those check out and you’re still having problems, your PC may not be connecting to your wireless network. To learn more, see Why can't I get online? For more advanced help, see Fix network connection issues in Windows.\nIf you're having trouble connecting to a Bluetooth printer, see Fix Bluetooth problems in Windows.\nNotes:\nIf you use wireless access points, extenders, or multiple wireless routers with separate SSIDs, make sure you're connected to the same network as the printer for your PC.\nIf your printer's status displays \"Printer in error state,\" there may be a problem with the printer itself.  If these first two steps did not resolve the error, check the printer for low paper or ink, and be sure the cover isn't open and the paper isn't jammed.\nIf your printer still doesn’t work, continue to step 3.\nStep 3. Uninstall and reinstall your printer\nTry removing and reinstalling the printer.\nRemove your printer\nSelect the Start  button, then select Settings  > Bluetooth & Devices  > Printers & scanners .\nSelect the printer you want to uninstall.\nSelect the Remove button. Then confirm you're sure you want to remove this device by selecting Yes.\nReinstall your printer\nIf your printer is turned on and connected to the network, Windows should find it easily. Available printers can include all printers on a network, such as Bluetooth and wireless printers, or printers that are plugged into another computer and shared on the network. You might need permission to install some printers. To reinstall your printer, follow these steps:\nSelect the Start  button, then select Settings  > Bluetooth & Devices  > Printers & scanners .\nMake sure your printer is turned on and connected.  Then select the Add device (or Refresh) button.\nPlease wait a moment while Windows searches for the printers that are connected to the device (locally or wirelessly).  Windows will then display a list of printers connected to your device.  If you see your printer listed, select the Add device button for your printer.  If you don't see your device listed, select Add manually.\nNotes:\nIf you use wireless access points, extenders, or multiple wireless routers with separate SSIDs, make sure you're connected to the same network as the printer for your PC to find and install it.\nIf you have a new wireless printer that hasn’t been added to your home network, read the instructions that came with the printer and check the printer manufacturer’s website to learn more and to get up-to-date software for your printer.\nTip: You can print a test page to make sure the printer is working correctly. If you've installed the printer but it doesn't work, check the manufacturer's website for troubleshooting information or driver updates.\nReinstall your printer manually\nIf the system cannot install the printer automatically, you can reinstall it manually. When you select Add manually, you will then see five options to Find a printer by other options.  Select the option that applies best for your situation and then follow the steps provided.  All of the options can apply for a printer that is connected wirelessly or through your network.  However, if your printer is connected directly to your computer locally, select Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings and then select Next.\nReinstall a local printer manually\nAfter selecting Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings, follow these steps:\nSelect Use an existing port and then select the port the printer is connected to.  Then select Next. If the printer is connected via USB, select it from the list. There are also options for parallel (LPT) and serial (COM) ports.\nYou will now see options to install the printer driver. If the printer came with a disc that includes the driver, select Have Disk. Otherwise, select Windows Update.\nPlease wait while Windows updates the list of printers.  Then select the printer manufacturer from the left column, and the printer model from the right column. Then select Next.\nType a name for your printer, and then select Next. This name is only for your personal reference, so you can choose any name you prefer.\nSelect Do not share this printer. (If you want to share your printer with other devices on your network, select Share this printer and enter the name and location.) Select Next.\nSelect Print a test page to confirm that the printer is working and then select Finish.\nIf your printer still doesn’t work, continue to step 4.\nStep 4. Install the latest driver for your printer\nMost printers require the latest driver to work well. To learn more, read How to download and install the latest printer drivers.\nIf your printer still doesn’t work after you install the latest driver for your printer, continue to step 5.\nStep 5. Clear and reset the print spooler\nIf the previous troubleshooting step is not successful, you may need to clear spooler files and restart the spooler service. The print spooler is a file that manages the printing process. To clear and reset the print spooler:\nIn the search box on the taskbar, type services, and then select Services in the list of results.\nSelect the Standards tab, and then double-click Print Spooler in the list of services.\nSelect Stop, and then select OK.\nIn the search box on the taskbar, enter %WINDIR%\\system32\\spool\\printers, select %WINDIR%\\system32\\spool\\PRINTERS in the list of results, and then delete all files in the folder.\nIn the search box on the taskbar, search for services, and then select Services in the list of results.\nSelect the Standards tab, and the double-click Print Spooler in the list of services.\nSelect Start, select Automatic in the Startup Type box, and then select OK.\nIf your printer still doesn’t work, continue on to step 6.\nStep 6.
